## Scheduler
This Calender/Scheduler application runs in the browser responsively, and it's powered by jQuery. Using the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time, this application allows users to save events and important events for each hour of the day. 
When the user views the timeblocks of the current day, each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The past is light pink, the present is light brown, and the future is light green. When the user enters an event, they can save that event in local storage, which means that they can refresh thier page and the saved events persist.
